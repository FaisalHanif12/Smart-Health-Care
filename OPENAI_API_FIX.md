# ðŸ”§ OpenAI API Key Fix

## Issue
- Frontend shows error: "Incorrect API key provided"
- Backend shows 500 Internal Server Error when generating plans

## Root Cause
The frontend `.env` file was missing, causing the app to use placeholder API keys.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Created Frontend .env File
- Location: `frontend/.env`
- Required content format:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY]
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**Note:** Copy the same API key from your `backend/.env` file

### 2. Backend .env File Already Configured
- Location: `backend/.env`
- OpenAI API key is properly set

## ðŸš€ Next Steps Required

### **IMPORTANT: You MUST restart both servers for changes to take effect!**

1. **Stop both servers** (Ctrl+C in both terminals)

2. **Restart Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Restart Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend  
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test the fix:**
   - Go to Workout Plan or Diet Plan page
   - Click "Generate AI Plan"
   - Should work without API key errors

## ðŸ”’ Security Note
- The `.env` files are gitignored for security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Each user should have their own `.env` files locally

## âœ… Expected Behavior After Fix
- âœ… Frontend AI service works with your OpenAI API key
- âœ… Backend AI service works as primary option
- âœ… Fallback to frontend if backend fails
- âœ… No more "Invalid API key" errors
- âœ… Diet and workout plans generate successfully
